Pseudo elements & classes diff
Pseudo classes let us style elements when they are in a specific state. For example, we can apply specific styles to an element only when it's being hovered over.

You can also do some fun things with pseudo elements. While pseudo classes style elements when they are in a specific state, pseudo elements style specific parts of an element.
